      <h1>The OpenTF Manifesto</h1>

      <div>
        <p>
          Terraform was open-sourced in 2014 under an MPL license.
          Over the next 9 years, it built up a community that included
          thousands of users, contributors, customers, certified
          practitioners, vendors, and an ecosystem of open-source
          modules, plugins, libraries, and extensions.
        </p>

        <p>
          On August 10th, 2023, HashiCorp switched Terraform to a
          non-open-source BSL license with no advance notice to the
          hundreds of unpaid individuals who voluntarily contributed
          to the success of Terraform and its ecosystem. This change
          threatens the entire Terraform community and ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our concern: the BSL license is a poison pill for Terraform.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overnight, tens of thousands of businesses, ranging from
          one-person shops to the Fortune 500, woke up to a new
          reality where the underpinnings of their infrastructure
          suddenly became a potential legal risk because the legal
          terms in the BSL license are vague.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, every company, vendor, and developer using Terraform
          must wonder whether what they do could be construed as
          competitive with HashiCorp. Even those that might be in the
          clear now, may not be clear in the future. How can you trust
          that your usage won't violate the license terms in the
          future? What if your product changes? What if
          <i>HashiCorp's product</i> changes? What if HashiCorp
          changes its interpretation of "competitive?" What if they
          change the license again?
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result of this license change, everything that uses
          Terraform is on shaky ground.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is clear that under the new license, the thriving
          Terraform ecosystem will dwindle and wither. Developers will
          be less likely to want to learn Terraform, pick it for their
          projects, and contribute to its ecosystem. Companies will be
          less likely to use Terraform to manage their infrastructure
          and, instead, will pick truly open-source alternatives
          without licensing uncertainty. Existing Terraform codebases
          will turn into liabilities, independent tooling will
          disappear, and the Terraform community will fracture and
          vanish.
        </p>

        <p>
          This sort of change not only fractures the Terraform
          community but it also harms all similar open-source
          projects. Imagine if the creators of Linux or Kubernetes
          suddenly switched to a non-open-source license that only
          permitted non-competitive usage. Would you still risk
          running your production software using those tools?
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, every company and developer will think twice before
          adopting and investing in an open-source project in case its
          creator suddenly decides to change the license.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's why the building blocks of the modern Internet, such
          as Linux and Kubernetes, are handed over to impartial bodies
          (the Linux Foundation and the Cloud Native Computing
          Foundation, respectively) who can ensure that those building
          blocks can form solid and predictable underpinnings for our
          industry.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our goal: ensure Terraform is handed over to an open-source
          foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In particular, we want to create a foundation for Terraform
          that is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Truly open source - under a well-known and
            widely-accepted license that companies can trust, that
            won't suddenly change in the future, and isn't subject
            to the whims of a single vendor
          </li>
          <li>
            Community-driven - so that the community governs the
            project for itself, where pull requests are regularly
            reviewed and accepted on their merit
          </li>
          <li>
            Impartial - so that valuable features and fixes are
            accepted based on their value to the community,
            regardless of their impact on any particular vendor
          </li>
          <li>
            Layered and modular - with a programmer-friendly project
            structure to encourage building on top, enabling a new
            vibrant ecosystem of tools and integrations
          </li>
          <li>
            Backward-compatible - so that the existing code can
            drive value for years to come
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="font-bold">
          Our request to HashiCorp: donate Terraform to this foundation.
        </p>

        <p>
          We ask HashiCorp to do the right thing by the community:
          instead of going forward with the BSL license change, donate
          Terraform to this foundation, and keep it under a genuinely
          open-source license. That way, instead of fracturing the
          community, we'll end up with a single, impartial, reliable
          home for Terraform. There, the whole community can unite to
          keep building this amazing ecosystem.
        </p>

        <p class="font-bold">Our fallback plan: fork Terraform.</p>

        <p>
          If HashiCorp is unwilling to donate Terraform to the
          foundation, we propose to fork Terraform and maintain the
          fork in the foundation. Supporting a fork will take time,
          skill, effort, and coordination. To this end, this pledge
          will pool our resources and build a more open, inclusive
          future for Terraform.
        </p>
